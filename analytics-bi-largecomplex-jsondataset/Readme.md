# Lakehouse, Warehouse, & Direct Lake using FDA OpenFDA Drug Adverse Events Dataset (1400+ Files, 400+ GB raw JSON data uncompressed) in Microsoft Fabric 

## Scenario
As part of the openFDA project, the FDA makes a variety of real world datasets publicly available for analysis, research, and other transparency. The goal of openFDA project as stated on [openFDA](https://open.fda.gov/about/) website is to "create easy access to public data, to create a new level of openness and accountability, to ensure the privacy and security of public FDA data, and ultimately to educate the public and save lives." In this module we will demonstrate Microsoft Fabric capabilities to ingest, transform, and report on this relatively large and complex real world health care dataset. The idea is to showcase how Microsoft Fabric provides an end to end analytics platform that has been built with ease of use in mind to draw value out of data faster without solving technical component integration challenges. The primary capabilities showcased by the module include large batch ingestion and flattening of json files into the following Microsoft Fabric: Fabric Lakehouse, Pipelines for orchestration, medallion architecture for data quality design enablement, the Fabric Warehouse for exploration and a data mart, and a Direct Lake Semantic Model for reporting in Power BI. The dataset consists of 1400+ JSON files which amounts to 400+ GB raw data on disk and complex nested JSON structure not very conducive for anlaytics and reporting.


**Note**: Downloading of the dataset is automated as part of the solution presented here so you don't need to download the dataset manually, but here is location of the dataset on openFDA webiste for reference - https://open.fda.gov/data/downloads/

## Solution Overview
![Drug Event Dataset](./images/SourceToTarget.png)

The Human Drug Adverse Event Dataset consists of 1400+ files and 400+ GB representing data from over 20 years. The data in these files has complex nested JSON structures which are flattened into relational tables using Spark Notebooks. 

The following screenshot shows one of the source files as an example source file which is the input data to be transformed into relational flattened tables by Spark notebooks.

The following screenshot gives a glimpse of the output in the Lakehouse after the first three steps (listed below) are successfully employed to download and flatten the data into relational tables in Silver Layer of Medallion Architecture.

## Pre-Requisites
A Fabric-enabled Workspace is the pre-requisite to be able to setup an end to end demonstration in your own environment.

## Steps to setup demo in your own environment

This section lists the links to pages with step by step by instructions, Step 1 to Step 5 shouldn't take more than 15 to 20 minutes to setup but have been broken into distinct steps for clarity. A walkthrough of Steps 1-3 is availalbe in the following video: https://youtu.be/KSHwJUoPVQY 

1. [Create Lakehouse, import Spark Notebooks and setup the Lakehouse association for Spark Notebooks](./docs/01-CreateLakehouse-SetupNotebooks.md)
2. [Create Pipeline to ingest and transform Drug Adverse Event Dataset into flattened Relational Tables](./docs/02-CreatePipeline.md)
3. [Run Pipeline to generate flattened relation tables in Silver Layer of Medallion Architecture](./docs/03-RunPipeline.md)
4. [Create Fabric Warehouse as a Gold layer that functions as a Data Mart for users with SQL skills](./docs/04-CreateWarehouse.md)
5. [Create a Fabric Direct Lake Semantic Model to build Power BI reports over your Warehouse](./docs/05-CreateDirectLake.md)
